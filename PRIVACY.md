# Privacy Policy for YouTube Subtitle Translator
**Last Updated: 2026-02-08**

This Privacy Policy describes how **YouTube Subtitle Translator** ("we", "us", or "our") handles your information when you use our Chrome extension.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

### Personal Data
We do **not** collect, store, share, or sell any personal information. You do not need to create an account to use this extension.

### Subtitle Data
To provide translation services, the extension extracts subtitle text from the YouTube video you are watching. This text is sent securely to **Google Translate API** for translation. The text is not stored on our servers.

### Dictionary Data
When you hover over a word to look it up, that specific word is sent to **Free Dictionary API** (dictionaryapi.dev) to retrieve definitions. We do not track which words you look up.

## 2. Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services to provide core functionality:

*   **Google Translate API**: Used for translating subtitles. Please refer to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
*   **Free Dictionary API**: Used for word definitions.

## 3. Data Storage

All user settings (e.g., target language preference, feature toggles) are stored locally on your device using `chrome.storage.sync`. This data is synced across your Chrome browsers logged into the same account but is not accessible by us.

## 4. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

## 5. Contact Us
